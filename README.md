# Reflect.jai

This is my personal reflection library for Jai, featuring a lot of data types and utilities that I find useful.
The included reflection library in Jai is actually quite minimal and could use some updating, in my opinion.

If you are doing anything that relies heavily on reflection, you may find this module useful.


## Features Overview

A couple of procedures for creating Type_Info structures

Utilities for comparing, copying, allocating, and manipulating Anys
